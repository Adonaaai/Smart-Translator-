# Smart Translator
A smart translator delivering context-aware results better than standard tools.

# About
Standard translation tools often produce robotic, literal outputs that lack context. I built **Smart Translator** to solve this problem by leveraging the **OpenRouter API** to connect with advanced LLMs.
This approach allows the application to understand nuance and deliver natural, context-aware translations.

## Technical Overview
This application communicates with  the OpenRouter using an HTTP 'POST' request. this sends a data package with some information to the server to be processed

## Features
- **High accuracy:** Leverages Large Language Models via OpenRouter.
- **Broad language Support:** Includes German, Japanese, Korean, and more.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully styled with custom CSS.
- **User FeedBack:** Interactive loading spinners and error alerts.


## How to Use
1. **Open the App:** Navigate to the live [Smart Translator](https://adonaaai.github.io/Smart-Translator-/) website.
2. **Get API Key:** Log in to your account and generate a key at [OpenRouter Keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).
3. **Start Translating:** Paste your key into the "API Key" field on the website and you are ready to go!
