# Smart Translator
A smart translator delivering context-aware results better than standard tools.

# About
Standard translation tools often produce robotic, literal outputs that lack context. I built **Smart Translator** to solve this problem by leveraging the **OpenRouter API** to connect with advanced LLMs.
This approach allows the application to understand nuance and deliver natural, context-aware translations.

## Features
- **High accuracy:** Leverages Large Language Models via OpenRouter.
- **Broad language Support:** Includes German, Japanese, Korean, and more.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully styled with custom CSS.
- **User FeedBack:** Interactive loading spinners and error alerts.

## Acknowledgments

- **CSS Styling:** Refined with the assistance of Google Gemini.
